# Origami_Structures-DMI-Code

Origami-based structures for defomable DMI design(EMCT final project)
Stepsï¼š
1. Connect the two devices separately via USB ports.

2. Open the Bela IDE through the Bela project and then launch the Arduino IDE.

3. Open the Max/MSP patch.

4. Connectivity test: On the Max side, verify that the Arduino sender matches the Max receiver and check if the baud rates correspond.

5. Run the Bela project and the Arduino sketch separately.

6. Drag any audio file format onto the linked interface of Part A and Part C to provide material for particle synthesis, then adjust the audio parameters in the Max patch to perform DIY sound design.
